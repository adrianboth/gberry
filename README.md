## Project Summary

GBerry is a game console platform focusing to local multiplayer experience. 
The project aims to bring the same social experience of playing together as 
traditional board games have provided. GBerry utilizes equipment found from 
ordinary homes: TV screens with audio devices, tablets and mobile devices. 
TV is used for showing main game events while mobile devices are used for 
controlling a game. The general purpose mobile application receives game 
specific control interface from a game console. The low cost Raspberry Pi 
is used as a game console hardware.
